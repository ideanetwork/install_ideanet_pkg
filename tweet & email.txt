I developed an app for #GroupConceptMapping using #Rstats that uses a menu driven interface for managing data, computation and visualization. App is open source, so free to use. This is a development version but thought I would share in case #eval colleagues and others may be interested in trying it out. If interested, respond to me directly, I'll share link details. 


EMAIL TEXT FOR THOSE INTERESTED

Thanks for your interest.
